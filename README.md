# Convolutional Neural Network


Overall, it is clear that Convolutional Neural networks are eﬀective. In our testing, we achieved a much higher training accuracy with CNNs. We also achieved a higher testing accuracy with CNNs, though there still remained a sizable gap between between testing accuracy and training accuracy, indicating a case of over-ﬁtting. In our experimentation, we found that changing the hyper-parameters of the CNNs could lead to minor improvements, but nothing noticeable. The highest accuracy we were able to achieve was with the AlexNet implementation, and in our analysis AlexNet’s biggest strength of how large of input data points it allowed for. It is clear that in the realm of image processing, Convolutional neural networks are quite powerful.
